# Working Title
This first person horror game began as a learning project to sharpen my skills in Unreal Engine 5.5, it quickly turned into a product that I've been working on in hopes to self publish on steam.

## Premise

You've just been hired as the IT guy for a lab experiment about human interaction with chimpanzee's. You were hired to maintain camera systems, mechanical doorways, and all other electronics that are used to run the experiment. What you weren't told was that you are the main test subject.
Your goal is to guide a hostile chimpanzee through the maze using a series of remotely controlled doors while observing it through 80's style CCTV cameras. However, you might need to enter the maze to fix systems that malfunction during the experiment.
Can you successfully complete the experiment without being caught by the chimp?

## Development

This project is currently being developed in UE 5.5 and is still being prototyped.  
My plan is to have a rough demo by late September, and a distributable one before the end of October.

# Working Title
This first person horror game began as a learning project to sharpen my skills in Unreal Engine 5.5, it quickly turned into a product that I've been working on in hopes to self publish on steam.

## Premise

You're a Veterinarian recently hired at a chimpanzee sanctuary. You've accidentally marked a new chimpanzee as having a clean bill of health, when in reality it has been infected with rabies.

Your goal is to get this chimp back into its enclosure using a series of poorly maintained remotely controlled doorways.

## Development

This project is currently being developed in UE 5.5 and is still being prototyped.  
My plan is to have a rough demo by late August, and a distributable one before October.
